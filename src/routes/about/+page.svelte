	<h2 class="sm:text-xl font-bold text-primary">What I know.</h2>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		I'm knowledgeable with math up to Calculus I, including Geometry and Trigonometry. With Physics
		I'm knowledgeable up to the end of Classical Mechanics. I would consider my self to be the most
		knowledgeable about computer science and software engineering. It is my daily job and I program
		many hours after work as well.
	</p>
	<h2 class="sm:text-xl font-bold text-primary">How I know it.</h2>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		I was born in rural Colorado, graduated high school in 2012, and then graduated from the
		University of Northern Colorado in 2019 with a two Bachelors degrees, one in Physics with an
		emphasis in Astronomy and the other in Software Engineering. After graduating I was able to find
		employment as a software engineer where I have been honing my programming and development skills
		for five years.
	</p>
	<h2 class="sm:text-xl font-bold text-primary">Why choose me?</h2>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		I believe that knowledge truly is a super power. I believe that with enough time anyone can
		learn any subject. I have spent a big portion of my life trying to uncover as much as I can
		about the world around us and now I am ready to share that excitement and hopefully spark
		curiosity in the next generation. I also build pretty good software. Thanks for your
		consideration.

	<h2 class="sm:text-xl font-bold">Early Life and College</h2>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		Growing up in rural Colorado I spent most of my time outside. We didn't have reliable internet
		at our house until I was well into high school. In high school I played a few sports, but I
		really loved playing tuba in the band and participating in school plays. I loved it so much I
		decided to attend the University of Northern Colorado to study music and eventually become a
		music teacher.
	</p>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		That first year of school changed my life in ways I might never fully understand, but at the end
		I felt like I just need to know more. More about life, more about the world around me and how it
		all worked, so I dropped out of the music program and changed my major to physics with an
		emphasis in astronomy. I'm not sure what drove me to choose astronomy, but the next four years I
		learned about the journey humanity has taken through science. From Copernicus and the initial
		movement of the planets, to Newton's laws and finally "learning" about quantum mechanics (quotes
		because while I did pass Quantum Mechanics I and II, I will not claim to understand it). It was
		beautiful and it opened up a world of science I could never have imagined. While music continues
		to be one of my life's loves, I cherish those years where I really struggled with the material,
		especially math.
	</p>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		Like all things, and certainly all good things, my physics studies came to an end and it was
		time to look for employment. After looking for jobs I realized that I probably needed to go to
		grad school to pursue a career in physics. I loved the challenge of obtaining my undergrad
		physics degree, but I didn't think myself up to the challenge of grad school at the time. This
		time, I didn't change my major, I just stayed an extra two years to obtain the credits for a
		software engineering degree. In these two years I immersed myself into the world of technology
		and tried to soak in as much information as I possibly could. I learned to program in python and
		java, soon started to love programming.
	</p>
	<h2 class="sm:text-xl font-bold">Professional Career</h2>
	<p class="sm:text-lg">
		After finishing up both degrees I was able to land a job for a company making labor management
		solutions for hotels and restaurants. I had done it, I had become a professional software
		engineer, now it was time to become a <strong>good</strong> one.
